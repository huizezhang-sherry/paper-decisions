title: "Dossier: visualizing/ understanding decision choices in data analysis via decision similarity"
abstract: "In data analysis, analysts are expected to clearly communicate the decisions they make, as these choices inform how results are interpreted and compared across studies. Such decisions -- for example, selecting the degree of freedom for a smoothing spline -- are often not systematically studied, since onece an analysis is published, it is done seldom revisited or replicated with alternative choices. In this work, we focus on a body of data analysis studies on the effect of particulate matter on mortality, conducted by researchers worldwide, which naturally provide alteranative analyes of the same question. We automatically extract analytic decisions from the published literature into structured data using Large Language Models (Claude and Gemini). We then proposed a pipeline to calculate paper similarity based on the semantic similarity of these extracted decisions and their reasons, and visualize the results through clustering algorithms. This approach offers an efficient way to study decision-making  practices than traditional interviews. We also provide insights into the use of LLMs for text extraction tasks and the communication of analytic choices in data analysis practice."

# Introduction

Decisions are everywhere in data analysis, from the initial data collection, data pre-processing to the modelling choices. These decisions will impact the final output of the data analysis, which may lead to different conclusions and policy recommendations. When such flexibility can be misused—through practices such as p-hacking, selective reporting, or unjustified analytical adjustments—it can inflate effect sizes or produce misleading results that meet conventional thresholds for statistical significance. They have been demonstrated through many-analysts experiments, where independent teams analyzing the same dataset to answer a pre-defined research question often arrive at markedly different conclusions. These practices not only compromise the validity of individual studies but also threaten the broader credibility of statistical analysis and scientific research as a whole.

Multiple recommendations have been proposed to improve data analysis practices, such as pre-registration and multiverse analysis. Bayesian methods also offer a different paradigm to p-value driven inference for interpreting statistical evidence. Most empirical studies of data analysis practices focus on specially designed and simplified analysis scenarios. While informative, these setups may not adequately capture the complexity of the data analysis with significant policy implications. \[In practice, studying the data analysis decisions with actual applications is challenging.\] Analysts may no longer be available for interviews due to job changes, and even when they are, recalling the full set of decisions and thinking process made during the analysis is often infeasible. Moreover, only until the last decades, analysis scripts and reproducible materials were not commonly required by journals for publishing. \[As a result, it remains challenging to study how analytical decisions are made. \]

In this work, we focus on a specific class of air pollution modelling studies that estimate the effect size of particulate matter (PM2.5 or PM10) on mortality, typically using Poisson regression or generalized additive models (GAMs). While individual modelling choices vary, these studies often share a common structure: they adjust for meteorological covariates such as temperature and humidity, apply temporal or spatial treatments, like including lagged variables and may estimate the effect by city or region before combining results. Because these studies investigate similar scientific questions using a shared modelling framework, they form a natural many-analyst setting. This allows us to examine, in a real-world context, the range of analytical decisions made by different researchers addressing the same underlying question.

<!-- This class of studies has significant impact to provide scientific evidence for to guide public policy on setting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for air pollutants in the U.S.  -->

In this work, we develop a structured tabular format to record the analytical decisions made by researchers in the air pollution modelling literature. Using large language models (LLMs), we automate the extraction of these decisions from published papers. This allows us to treat decisions as data – allowing us to track them over time, compare methodology across papers, and query commonly used approaches. We further introduce a workflow to cluster studies based on decision similarity, revealing three distinct groups of papers that reflect the modelling strategies differs in the European and U.S. studies, which offers a new way to visualize the field in the air pollution mortality modelling.

The contribution of this work includes:

-   A new approach to study data analysis decision choices through automatic extraction of decisions from scientific literature using LLMs,

-   A dataset compiled from 62 papers to study decision-making in air pollution mortality modelling,

-   A pipeline to construct similarities between papers based on decision similarities, and

-   Issues we found from existing data analysis reporting

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In @sec-background, we review the background on data analysis decisions. @sec-extract-decisions describes the data structure for recording decisions, the use of large language models to process research papers, and the validation of LLM outputs. In @sec-paper-similarity, we present the method for calculating paper similarity based on decision similarities. @sec-result reports the finding of our analysis, including the clustering of papers according to similarity scores and sensitivity analyses related to LLM providers, prompt engineering, and LLM parameters. Finally, @sec-discussion discusses the implications of our study.

## Decision-making in data analysis

A data analysis is a process of making choices at each step, from the initial data collection to model specification, and post-processing. Each decision represents a branching point where analysts choose a specific path to follow, and the vast number of possible choices analysts can take forms what @gelman2014 describe as the "garden of forking paths". While researchers may hope their inferential results are robust to the specific path taken through the garden, in practice, different choices can lead to substantially different conclusions. This has been empirically demonstrated through "many analyst experiments", where independent research groups analyze the same dataset to the same answer using their chosen analytic approach. A classic example is @silberzahn2018, where researchers reported an odds ratio from 0.89 to 2.93 for the effect of soccer players’ skin tone on the number of red cards awarded by referees. Similar variability has been observed in structural equation modeling [@sarstedt2024], applied microeconomics [@huntington-klein2021], neuroimaging [@botvinik-nezer2020], and ecology and evolutionary biology [@gould2025].

Examples above have rendered decision-making in data analysis as a subject to study in data science. To collect data on how analysts making decisions during data analysis, researchers have conducted interviews with analysts and researchers on data analysis practices [@kale2019; @alspaugh2019; @liu_understanding_2020], visualization of the decision process through the analytic decision graphics (ADG) [@liu2020]. Recently, @simson2025 describes a participatory approach to decisions choices in fairness ML algorithms. Software tools have also developed to incorporate potential alternatives in the analysis workflow, including the `DeclareDesign` package [@blair2019] and the `multiverse` package [@multiverse]. The `DeclareDesign` package [@blair2019] introduces the MIDA framework for researchers to declare, diagnose, and redesign their analyses to produce a distribution of the statistic of interest, which has been applied in the randomized controlled trial study [@bishop2024]. The `multiverse` package [@multiverse] provides a framework for researchers to systematically explore how different choices affect results and to report the range of plausible outcomes that arise from alternative analytic paths. Other systems have been developed to visualize `multiverse` analysis [@liu2021].

## Visualization on scientific literature

Much of the work on IEEE visualizing scientific literature focuses on helping researchers stay aware of relevant publications, given the rapidly growing volume of scientific output and the difficulty of navigating it. Systems have been developed to support the discovery of relevant papers, where relevance is typically determined by keywords [@isenberg2017], citation information (e.g. citation list, co-citation) [@chen2006], or combinations with other relevant paper metadata (e.g. author, title) [@bethard2010; @chou2011; @dörk2012; @heimerl2016]. More recent approaches incorporate text-based information from the abstract or sections of the paper to \[obtain a better similar metric\]. This includes using topic modelling [@alexander2014], argumentation-based information retrieval [@tbahriti2006], and text embedding [@narechania2022]. While these metadata information and high level text-based information are valuable for discovering relevant papers, for data analysis, researchers need tools that help them *make sense* of the literature rather than simply *finding* it. Capturing the decisions and reasoning expressed during analyses within a similar theme can reveal common practices in the field and guide decisions choices in new applications. With recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), it has become possible to automatically extract structured information from unstructured text through prompting. This allows scientific literature to be clustered and visualized using information about the underlying decisions and reasoning made during analysis, providing a basis for studying analysts' decision choices.

## Air pollution mortality modelling

# Extracting decisions from data analysis {#sec-extract-decisions}

## Decisions in data analysis {#sec-decisions}

Decisions occur throughout the entire data analysis process -- from the selection of variables and data source, to pre-processing steps to prepare the data for modelling, to the model specification and variable inclusion. In this work, we focus specifically on modelling decisions in the air pollution mortality modelling literature. These include the choice of modelling approach, covariate inclusion and smoothing, and specifications of spatial and temporal structure. Consider the following excerpt from @ostro2006:

> Based on previous findings reported in the literature (e.g., Samet et al. 2000), the basic model included a smoothing spline for time with 7 degrees of freedom (df) per year of data. This number of degrees of freedom controls well for seasonal patterns in mortality and reduces and often eliminates autocorrelation.

This sentence encode the following components of a decision:

-   **variable**: time
-   **method**: smoothing spline
-   **parameter**: degree of freedom (df)
-   **reason**: Based on previous findings reported in the literature (e.g., Samet et al. 2000); This number of degrees of freedom controls well for seasonal patterns in mortality and reduces and often eliminates autocorrelation.
-   **decision**: 7 degrees of freedom (df) per year of data

The decision above is regarding a certain parameter in the statistical method, we categorize this as a "parameter" type decisions. Other types of decisions - such as spatial modelling structure or the inclusion of temporal lags - may not include an explicit method or parameter, but still reference a variable and rationale, which we will provide further examples below.

To record these decisions, we follow the tidy data principle [@wickham2014], where each variable should be in a column, each observation in a row. In our context, each row represents a decision made by the authors of a paper and an analysis often include multiple decisions. To retain the original context of the decision, we extract the original text in the paper, without paraphrase or summarization, from the paper. Below we present an example of how to structure the decisions made in a paper, using the paper by @ostro2006:

| Paper | ID | Model | variable | method | parameter | type | reason | decision |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| ostro | 1 | Poisson regression | temperature | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | parameter | NA | 3 degree of freedom |
| ostro | 2 | Poisson regression | temperature | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | temporal | NA | 1-day lag |
| ostro | 3 | Poisson regression | relative humidity | LOESS | smoothing parameter | parameter | to minimize Akaike's Information Criterion | NA |
| ostro | 4 | Poisson regression | model | NA | NA | spatial | to account for variation among cities | separate regression models fit in each city |

Most decisions in the published papers are not explicitly stated, this could due to the coherence and conciseness of the writing or authors' decision to include only necessary details. Here, we identify a few common anomalies where decisions may be combined or omit certain fields:

1.  **Authors may combine multiple decisions into a single sentence** for coherence and conciseness of the writing. Consider the following excerpt from @ostro2006:

> Other covariates, such as day of the week and smoothing splines of 1-day lags of average temperature and humidity (each with 3 df), were also included in the model because they may be associated with daily mortality and are likely to vary over time in concert with air pollution levels.

This sentence contains four decisions: two for temperature (the temporal lag and the smoothing spline parameter) and two for humidity. These decisions should be structured as separate entries.

2.  **The justification does not directly address the decision choice.** In the example above, the stated rationale ("and are likely to vary over time in concert with air pollution levels") supports the general inclusion of temporal lags but does not justify the specific choice of 1-day lag over alternatives, such as 2-day average of lags 0 and 1 (lag01) and single-day lag of 2 days (lag2). As such, the reason field should be recorded as NA.

3.  **Some decisions may be omitted because they are data-driven**. For instance, @katsouyanni2001 states:

> The inclusion of lagged weather variables and the choice of smoothing parameters for all of the weather variables were done by minimizing Akaike’s information criterion.

In this case, while the method of selection (minimizing AIC) is specified, the actual degree of freedom used is not. Such data-driven decisions may be recorded with "NA" in the decision field, but the reason field should still be recorded as "by minimizing Akaike’s information criterion"

4.  **Information required to interpret the decision may be distributed across multiple sections**. In the previous example, "weather variables" refers to mean temperature and relative humidity, as defined earlier in the text. This requires cross-referencing across sections to identify the correct variables associated with each modeling choice.

<!-- | Paper | ID | Model | variable | method | parameter | type | reason | decision | -->

<!-- |-----|--|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------| -->

<!-- | ostro | xx | Poisson regression | temperature | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | parameter | NA | 3 df | -->

<!-- | ostro | xx | Poisson regression | temperature | NA | NA | temporal | NA | 1-day lag | -->

<!-- | ostro | xx | Poisson regression | relative humidity | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | parameter | NA | 4 df | -->

<!-- | ostro | xx | Poisson regression | relative humidity | NA | NA | temporal | NA | 1-day lag | -->

<!-- | katsouyanni2001 | xx | generalized additive models (GAM) Poisson regression | mean temperature | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | parameter | by minimizing Akaike’s information criterion | NA | -->

<!-- | katsouyanni2001 | xx | generalized additive models (GAM)  Poisson regression | relative humidity | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | parameter | by minimizing Akaike’s information criterion | NA | -->

## Automatic reading of literature with LLMs

**TODO**: Prompt engineering: these models may paraphrase or hallucinate unless explicitly told not to since it is generative in nature based on the predicted probability of the next word from the text and the instruction

**TODO**: The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering Techniques <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06608>

While decisions can be extracted manually from the literature, this process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential for automating the extraction of structured information from unstructured text \[ref\]. In this work, we use LLMs to automatically identify decisions made by authors during their data analysis processes.

Text recognition from PDF document relies on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert scanned images into machine-readable text -- capability currently offered by Antropic Claude and Google Gemini. We instruct the LLM to generate a markdown file containing a JSON block that records extracted decisions, which can then be read into statistical software for further analysis. The exact prompt feed to the LLM is provided in the Appendix. The `ellmer` package [@ellmer] in R is used to connect to the Gemini and Claude API, providing the PDF attachment and the prompt in a markdown file as inputs.

## Review the LLM output

-   **TODO** something about result validation of LLM output

The shiny app is designed to provide users a visual interface to review and edit the decisions extracted by the LLM from the literature. The app allows three actions from the users: 1) *overwrite* -- modify the content of a particular cell, equivalently `dplyr::mutate(xxx = ifelse(CONDITION, "yyy" , xxx))`, 2) *delete* -- remove a particular cell, `dplyr::filter(!(CONDITION))`, and 3) *add* -- manually enter a decision, `dplyr::bind_rows()`. @fig-shiny illustrates the *overwrite* action in the Shiny application, where users interactively filter the data and preview the rows affected by their edits—in this case, changing the model entry from "generalized additive Poisson time series regression" to the less verbose "Poisson regression". Upon confirmation, the corresponding `tidyverse` code is generated, and users can download the edited table and incorporate the code into their R script.

# Calculating paper similarity {#sec-paper-similarity}

Once the decisions have been extracted and validated, this opens up a structured data for analyzing these information. For example, we can compare whether author's choices at different times changes, or across decisions varies at different regions. In this section, we present a method to calculate paper similarity based on the decisions shared in the paper pairs. The goal is to construct a distance metric based on similarity of the decision choice among papers that could be further used for clustering paper based on choices made by different authors in the literature. An overview of the method is illustrated in @fig-similarity-diag.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Workflow for calculating paper similarity based on decision choices: (1) standardize variable names, (2) identify most frequent variable-type decisions across all papers, (3) identify papers with at least x identified decisions, (4) calculate decisions similarity score on the *decision* and *reason* fields using transformer language models, e.g. BERT, (5) calculate paper similarity score based on aggregating decision similarity scores."

-   **TODO** some discussion on what it means by for two papers to be similar based on decisions.

The calculation of paper similarity is based on the similarity of decisions shared by each paper pair. A decision comparable in two papers are the ones that share the same variable and type, e.g. temperature and parameter (a decisions on the choosing the statistical method *parameter* for the *temperature* variable), or humidity and temporal (any *temporal* treatment, e.g. choice of lag value for the *humidity* variable). While many decisions share a similar variable, different authors may refer to them with slightly different names, such as "mean temperature" and "average temperature", hence variable names are first standardized to a common set of variable names. For example, "mean temperature" and "average temperature" are both standardized to "temperature". Notice that "dewpoint temperature" is standardized into "humidity" since it is a proxy of temperature to achieve a relative humidity (RH) of 100%. For literature with a common theme, there is usually a set of variables that shared by most papers and additional variables are justified in individual research. For our air pollution mortality modelling literature, we standardize the following variable names:

-   **temperature**: "mean temperature", "average temperature", "temperature", "air temperature", "ambient temperature"
-   **humidity**: "dewpoint temperature" and its hyphenated variants, relative humidity", "humidity"
-   **PM**: "pollutant", "pollution", "particulate matter", "particulate", "PM10", "PM2.5"
-   **time**: "date", "time", "trends", "trend"

Depending on the specific pairs, papers have varied number of decisions that can be compared and aggregated. While paper similarities can be computed for all paper pairs, using the similarity of one or two pair of decisions to represent paper similarity is less ideal. Hence, before calculating the text similarity of decisions, we also include two optional steps to identify and subset the most frequent decisions across papers, and to retain only papers that report more than a certain number of frequent decisions. Research questions in different fields may have different levels of homogeneity, depending on the maturity of the field and for air pollution mortality modelling, it is helpful to focus on decisions and papers that share a substantial number of decisions.

To assign numerical value for the similarity of reason, we use a transformer language model, such as BERT, to measure the semantic text similarity between the decision itself and its justification. The decision similarity is calculated by comparing the *decision* and *reason* fields of the decisions in each paper pair. To obtain paper similarity, we average the decision similarities across all decisions in each paper pair and other method can be customized for aggregation. The resulting paper similarity score can be used as a distance matrix to cluster papers based on their decision choices to understand the common practices in the investigated literature.

Decision quality summary

-   missingness of the reason and decisions for the paper - how often papers report decisions
-   look at for one type of decision (time) - what are the choices made by different papers
-   look at whether decisions changes across time (cluster diagram with year)
-   Visualize the decision database: apply clustering algorithm and visualize the clusters
-   a characterization of the field, what are the common variables included, what smoothing methods are used, what are the options for temporal lags often considered, how are models generally estimated spatially.
-   For `lee2006association`, it is not clear what specific smoothing method the sentence "smooth function of the day of study" refers to.

<!-- In @ito2006, a set of weather models is used for sensitivity analysis, while Gemini generates variations in the extent to which these decisions are incorporated. In @huang2009, the term "smoothing function" appears prior to the use of the actual penalized spline to describe the smoothing method. Gemini may capture one or both of these in its extraction. -->

## Sensitivity analysis {#sec-sensitivity}

In this section, we examine the reproducibility for using LLMs for text extraction tasks in @sec-llm-reproducibility, discrepancies between different LLM models: Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`) and Claude (`claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`) in @sec-llm-models, and the sensitivity of our paper similarity calculation pipeline to the choice of text model used for computing decision similarity scores in @sec-text-model.

For our text extraction task, we test the reproducibility of Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`) by repeating the text extraction task 5 times for each of the 62 papers. For each of the 31 papers, five runs yield $5 \times 4 /2 = 10$ pairwise comparisons per field and including both the “reason” and “decision” fields results in a total of $31 \times 10 \times 2 = 620$ pairs. We exclude the pairs that have different number of decisions since it would require manually align the decision to compare and this left us with `r nrow(llm_temp_df |> filter(!is.na(n_diff)))` out of `r nrow(llm_temp_df)` (`r scales::label_percent()(nrow(llm_temp_df |> filter(!is.na(n_diff)))/nrow(llm_temp_df))`) pairwise comparisons. @tbl-gemini-1 shows an example of such comparison in @andersen2008, where all the four reasons are identical among the two runs, hence a zero number of difference.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-gemini-1
#| tbl-cap: "An example of comparing the text extraction in decisions in Andersen 2008."
res <-  all_geminis |> 
    filter(str_detect(paper, "andersen2008size")) |>
    group_split(paper)

tibble(Variable = res[[2]]$variable, 
       Run1 = res[[2]]$decision, 
       Run2 = res[[3]]$decision) |> 
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(1, 2)) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

@tbl-gemini-2 summarizes the number of differences observed in each pairwise comparison. Among all comparisons, `r scales::label_percent()(tbl$prop[[1]] / 100)` produce the identical text in reason and decision. The discrepancies come from the following reasons:

-   Gemini extracted different length for the same decision, e.g. in @kan2007, some runs may extract "singleday lag models underestimate the cumulative effect of pollutants on mortality 2day moving average **of current and previous day concentrations** (lag=01)", while others extract "singleday lag models underestimate the cumulative effect of pollutants on mortality 2day moving average (lag=01)". Similarity, for decisions, some runs may yield "10 df for total mortality", while other runs yield "10 df". Similar extraction appears in @breitner2009.
-   Gemini fails to extract reasons in some runs but not others, e.g. in @burnett1998, the first run generates NAs in the reasons, but the remaining four runs are identical. In @ueda2009 and @castillejos2000 , runs 1 and 5 fail to extract the reasons and produce the same incomplete version, whereas runs 2, 3, and 4 produce accurate versions with reasons populated.

### LLM models {#sec-llm-models}

Reading text from PDF document requires Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert images into machine-readable text, which currently is only supported by Antropic Claude (`claude-3-7-sonnet-latest`) and Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`).

We compare the number of decisions extracted by Claude and Gemini across all 62 papers in @fig-claude-gemini. Each point represents a paper, with the x- and y-axes showing the number of decisions extracted by Claude and Gemini, respectively. The dashed 1:1 line marks where both models extract the same number of decisions. Most points fall below this line, indicating that Claude extracts more decisions -- often from data pre-processing or secondary data analysis steps requiring more manual validation -- whereas Gemini focuses more on modelling choices relevant to our analysis. Some of these decisions captured by Claude are

-   the definition of "cold day" and "hot day" indicators in @dockery1992 ("defined at the 5th/ 95th percentile"),
-   the choice to summarize $\text{NO}_2$, $\text{O}_3$, and $\text{SO}_2$ using a "24 hr average on variable" in @huang2009, and
-   the definition of black smoke and in @katsouyanni2001 for secondary analysis ("restrict to days with BS concentrations below 150 $\mu g/m^2$").

Gemini sometimes also include irrelevant decisions, such as in @mar2000, where secondary analysis choices like "0-4 lag days" for air pollution exposure variables (CO, EC, $\text{K}_S$, $\text{NO}_2$, $\text{O}_3$, OC, Pb, S, $\text{SO}_2$, TC, Zn) are captured. However, these cases are less frequent, resulting in outputs with less noise overall.

For both Claude and Gemini, we find they fail to link the general term "weather variables" to the specific weather variables. For example Gemini misses this link in @dockery1992 and @burnett2004, while Claude does so in @dockery1992 and @katsouyanni2001. Although our prompt specified that some decisions may require linking information across sentences and paragraphs to identify the correct variable, this instruction doesn't appear to be applied consistently.

### Text model {#sec-text-model}

We have conducted sensitivity analysis on the text model for obtaining the decision similarity score from the Gemini outputs. The tested language models tested include

1)  BERT by Google [@devlin2019],
2)  RoBERTa by Facebook AI [@liu], trained on a larger dataset (160GB v.s. BERT's 15GB),
3)  XLNnet by Google Brain [@yang], and

two domain-trained BERT models:

4)  sciBERT [@beltagy2019], trained on scientific literature, and
5)  bioBERT [@lee2020], trained on PubMed and PMC data.

@fig-text-density presents the distribution of the decision similarity (left) and paper similarity (right) for each text model. At decision level, the BERT model produces the widest variation across all five models, while the similarity scores from XLNet are all close to 1. These scores are not comparable across models since the difference of the underlying transformer architecture. However, the paper similarity scores from each model are comparable and @fig-text-mds shows the multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) of the paper similarity scores from each text model: all showing a similar clustering pattern of the three main smoothing methods.

# Discussion {#sec-discussion}

-   Address how sensitivity analysis is/ is not relevant

-   Only prompting engineering is used to extract decisions from the literature. We expect that fine-tuning the model on statistical or domain-specific literature to yield more robust performance on the same document, though it would require substantially more training effort.

-   people from the NYU-LMU workshop are interested to have code script attached as well because people can do one thing in the script but report another in the paper - it would be interesting to compare the paper and the script with some syntax extraction.

-   Validation of the output:

the nature of the task: Our task involve a reasoning component in that it requires casual reasoning to identify the decisions made by the authors, and its justification/ rationale, rather than purely summarizing the text through pattern-matching.
