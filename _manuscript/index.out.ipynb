    "H. Sherry Zhang (University of Texas at Austin)  \n",
    "Roger D. Peng (University of Texas at Austin)\n",
    "\n",
    "this is the abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Something about “analysis review” - Roger thinks it’s a better to have a new word for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "provide a baseline understand - place to start\n",
    "\n",
    "demonstrate - analytically homogeneous - the table won’t look like that\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, we design a tabular format to record the choices made by analysts during data analysis. Using large language models, we automatically extract these choices from a set of research papers focused on specific topics, e.g. air pollution modelling. This allows us to analyze these choices as data – tracking how they’ve changed over time or query the possible methodologies used in similar studies. We also introduce a workflow to cluster paper based on decision similarity, using both the decisions themselves and the justifications authors provide for their choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis as an complicated, iterative process to make sense \\[ref\\] of the data collected. The iterative process of formulating hypothesis Jun et al. ([2022](#ref-jun2022)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choices are made at nearly every stage of data analysis, ranging from variable pre-processing variables, variable and lag selection in model formulation, to the specification of smoothing parameter during model construction. These possible choices contribute to what Gelman and Loken ([2014](#ref-gelman2014)) describe as the “garden of forking paths”. These choices can introduce substantial variability in results, which has been demonstrated in many-analyst experiments, where independent teams analyzing the same dataset to answer a pre-defined research question often arrive at markedly different conclusions. A prominent example is Silberzahn et al. ([2018](#ref-silberzahn2018)) where researchers reported a wide range of point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the effect of soccer players’ skin tone on the number of red cards awarded by referees (odds ratio from 0.89 to 2.93). Similar findings have emerged in other domains, including structural equation modeling ([Sarstedt et al. 2024](#ref-sarstedt2024)), applied microeconomics ([Huntington-Klein et al. 2021](#ref-huntington-klein2021)), neuroimaging ([Botvinik-Nezer et al. 2020](#ref-botvinik-nezer2020)), and ecology and evolutionary biology ([Gould et al. 2025](#ref-gould2025)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another line of work focuses on developing software tools to support analysts in making more informed decisions. For example, the `Tisane` package ([Jun et al. 2022](#ref-jun2022)) integrates conceptual ideas, such as DAGs, and modelling structure (group/ cluster/ hierarchical structure), to assist junior researchers in specifying GLM and GLMM model. The `DeclareDesign` package ([Blair et al. 2019](#ref-blair2019)) introduces the MIDA framework for researchers to declare, diagnose, and redesign their analyses to produce a distribution of the statistic of interest. This approach has been applied in randomized controlled trial ([Bishop and Hulme 2024](#ref-bishop2024)) .\n",
    "\n",
    "The `multiverse` package\n",
    "\n",
    "-   facilitates the specification and execution of multiple parallel choices for sensitivity analysis, allowing researchers to systematically explore how different choices affect results and to report the range of plausible outcomes that arise from alternative analytic paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study decisions in data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   interview analysts and researchers to provide recommendation for data analysis practices ([Kale, Kay, and Hullman 2019](#ref-kale2019); [Alspaugh et al. 2019](#ref-alspaugh2019); [Yang Liu, Althoff, and Heer 2020](#ref-liu2020)).\n",
    "-   Yang Liu, Althoff, and Heer ([2020](#ref-liu2020)) provides visualization to communicate the decision processes through the Analytic Decision Graphs (ADG)\n",
    "-   Simson et al. ([2025](#ref-simson2025)) conducts a participatory AI study to demonstrate the “garden of forking paths” of decisions in data analysis and how it affects ML fairness\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Recording decisions in data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "-   give example from extracting decision from sentences of a paper\n",
    "-   adapt from the tidy data principle - each row is a decision Wickham ([2014](#ref-wickham2014))  \n",
    "-   some decisions are related to how the variable is estimated spatially and temporally\n",
    "-   model level decisions on how the model is estimated spatially (for multi-site analyses) and/or temporally (different treatments for years or seasons)\n",
    "-   sometimes the decisions are not explicitly stated in the paper (use AIC to choose the degree of freedom in a smoothing spline)\n",
    "-   sometimes the reason is not explicitly stated (e.g., why 3 degree of freedom)\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothetical database of decisions may look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Paper | ID | Model | variable | method | parameter | type | reason | decision |\n",
    "|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| ostro | 1 | Poisson regression | temperature | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | parameter | NA | 3 degree of freedom |\n",
    "| ostro | 2 | Poisson regression | temperature | smoothing spline | degree of freedom | temporal | NA | 1-day lag |\n",
    "| ostro | 3 | Poisson regression | relative humidity | LOESS | smoothing parameter | parameter | to minimize Akaike’s Information Criterion | NA |\n",
    "| ostro | 4 | Poisson regression | model | NA | NA | spatial | to account for variation among cities | separate regression models fit in each city |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Automatic reading of literature with LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We use LLM to automatic process the literature to output analysis decisions. Currently, two LLMs, Antropic Claude and Google Gemini, are able to take input of pdf documents and the results reported in this paper is based on Gemini’s output. See the section sensitivity analysis for the comparison of the two models.\n",
    "-   Claude is decoder only, Gemini is an encoder–decoder model\n",
    "    -   these models may paraphrase or hallucinate unless explicitly told not to since it is generative in nature based on the predicted probability of the next word from the text and the instruction\n",
    "-   prompt: instruct the LLM to produce a markdown file with decisions included in a JSON block with the fields described in Section xxx\n",
    "-   use the `ellmer` package ([Wickham, Cheng, and Jacobs 2025](#ref-ellmer)) to connect to Gemini API to process the pdf documents in R.\n",
    "-   experiment with seed and temperature\n",
    "-   Our task involve a reasoning component in that it requires casual reasoning to identify the decisions made by the authors, and its justification/ rationale, rather than purely summarizing the text through pattern-matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Review the LLM output\n",
    "\n",
    "-   something about result validation of LLM output\n",
    "\n",
    "The shiny app is designed to provide users a visual interface to review and edit the decisions extracted by the LLM from the literature. The app allows three actions from the users: 1) *overwrite* – modify the content of a particular cell, equivalently `dplyr::mutate(xxx = ifelse(CONDITION, \"yyy\" , xxx))`, 2) *delete* – remove a particular cell, `dplyr::filter(!(CONDITION))`, and 3) *add* – manually enter a decision, `dplyr::bind_rows()`. <a href=\"#fig-shiny\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Figure 1</a> illustrates the *overwrite* action in the Shiny application, where users interactively filter the data and preview the rows affected by their edits—in this case, changing the model entry from “generalized additive Poisson time series regression” to the less verbose “Poisson regression”. Upon confirmation, the corresponding `tidyverse` code is generated, and users can download the edited table and incorporate the code into their R script."
